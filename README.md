# PrestaShop Greek Cahracters Fix
PrestaShop has an issue with Greek Cahracters in Customer threads, order messages etc, this overrides some files to fix this issue!

This overrides core files. 
The changes are small. 
The files that are copieed and edited are from PrestaShop version 1.7.8.7
This works in versions >1.7.7.X

# How to use it
Simply download and extract the contents in root folder of your prestashop, click to override files and thats all folks! :)
